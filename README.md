# FIB-IA-MarsRoverPlanner

Automated planification for transporting supplies in mars in PDDL for the third part of the Artificial Intelligence subject.

To try our planners we use Fast-Forward and Metric Fast-Forward planning systems, developed by Joerg for the 2nd International Planning Competition. You can download FF and Metric FF here:
